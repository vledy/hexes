# Hexes (hex-collide.)

Hexes, implemented in Godot, is a 2-4 player game played on a hexagonal board.

## Background

Back in Spring of 2019, I took a Intro to Game Design class where the final project was to design and implement a (physical) game and gameboard. Afterwards, I thought it would be interesting to create a digital version of the game. While the game's rules may not be ideal for a physical boardgame, I still found it an interesting project to implement.

## Status

The game itself is playable (as game rules have been implemented). Certain features (such as game mode) have not yet been implemented (currently in progress). The # of players option works, but the visual indicator is lacking; this will likely be fixed in an update in the next few days. 

The exe directory contains an .exe plus a .pck of the game that is runnable in Windows when both files are in the same folder.
